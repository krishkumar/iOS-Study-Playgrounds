 ## GCD Queues
 [NS]Operation queues are built on top of a technology called `libdispatch`, or *Grand Central Dispatch*. This is an advanced open-source technology that underpins concurrent programming on Apple technologies. It uses the now-familiar queuing model to greatly simplify concurrent programming, up until recently via a C-level interface. However, Swift 3 has greatly improved the GCD API, so it's no longer nearly as challenging.

 ### Using a Global Queue
 iOS has some global queues, where every task eventually ends up being executed. You can use these directly. You need to use the main queue for UI updates.

//: ### Creating your own Queue
//: Creating your own queues allow you to specify a label, which is super-useful for debugging.
//: You can specify whether the queue is serial (default) or concurrent (see later).
//: You can also specify the QOS or priority (here be dragons)
